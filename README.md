#### About

This project is conducted as part of [Udacity Deep Learning Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning-nanodegree--nd101) compulsory projects. The goal of the project is to test my understanding of Convolutional Neural Network. I also made an app  using [streamlit](https://www.streamlit.io/) to showcase the final output of the project.
